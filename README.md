## Limitation of responsibility

Schools.by TOS prohibits any usage of third-party programs with their website without their written permission.

Given that, I'm not responsible for any consequences of using this library.

__As a side note, I think that their TOS is not valid, but I'm not a lawyer, so I'm not going to argue with them.__
